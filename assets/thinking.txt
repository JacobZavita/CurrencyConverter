Lines 1-8 we declare global variables that will be used later.

Then we have three global functions that:
1 - converts the month in the date for historical data to an integer
2 - function for grabbing the date a week ago
3 - function for grabbing the date a week ago

An array for fiat and crypto currencies

line 291+
user lands on page and we axios call with our baseCurrency set to USD by default.
*** I could give the user an option to change their base Currency of choice.

we grab that data from currency layer and declare source and quotes

Then we call axios again and grab data from a week ago and a day ago.

Then we target the fiatChart innerHTML and set it to blank.
For each item in the fiatArray we do a bunch of things
  

I wrapped that up in a function called grabAndRenderFiat

On to landing, grabbing, and rendering for cryptos

Why did I call it top20? What does that do differently than data?

***Find a way to 

Could I just create a constructor for the innerHTML? They're all (currency, amount, change24, change 7, favorites)
So how do I get to that data from each api?

May be able to turn dayChange/weekChange into functions. Or jsut define them globally once.

I should definitely be able to make the rending of the elements a function that gets the data passed in.

I'd also benefit from jkeeping the variables the same across the whole application.
